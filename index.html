                <strong> Mordecai Mwini Kimeu,Wachira Gatama ,</strong> and <strong>Kenneth Muya Mukhwana</strong> created the
                Kenyan afro-pop band <em>H_art The Band.</em> In 2013, they sang a political song during the election periods and people started asking them what was the name of their band. They hadn’t even thought of themselves as a band before that moment. Before settling on H_art the band, they had played around with other names such as Waluhya na Swag and Young achievers.

            <p>
               After that they signed a deal with Penya records and were enrolled in Sauti Sol Academy. Little by little, they grew as a band and started performing in gigs. They then felt ready enough to record a song but the label was hesitant. Through their persistence, the label allowed them to record a song. This was when they released their first hit song Uliza Kiatu (Ask my shoe). The song was a massive success with radio stations playing it followed by TV stations.

                In 2019, they released their first album “Made in the Streets.” This is because they came from humble backgrounds with those around the streets being the first people to accept them. The three used to live in Kayole in a single room. The album was also a narration of how they fought to achieve success. It is a work of art with all its songs being entertaining or inspirational or both. The band worked on this album for three years before releasing it. The album features guest artists, like Victoria Kimani and Nyota Ndogo. The major themes are love and individuality but it also contains a political song called ‘Papaya’ that questions the loyalty of politicians and the crimes committed by ordinary people.

        <h2 class="why_heading">Why H_art The Band?</h2>
        <p>
            For the following reasons, I would always choose them over any other band:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Musical Style</strong> - Their musical style is different from others as they sing
                as if the are telling a story.they sing some of their songs from what they they have experienced in life of what people are going through.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Their Inspiration</strong> - H_art The Band's music is highly influenced by everyday life. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fusion of Poetry and Music</strong> - Various Kenyan Poets that have explored other kinds of
                poetry performance not with the same success as H_art The Band.</li>
        </ul>

                    The following is a list of their songs or album:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/rd00ZV9yPAU">
                        Uliza Kiatu </a> </strong> - The inspiration for the song was Mordecai’s shoes which were old and worn out. The other two would make fun of his shoes saying that if one needed to know his story all they needed to do was look at his shoes. And if the shoes could talk, then it would narrate their struggles. This song was their breakthrough single as it went on to gain national acclaim. It talked of the struggles of ordinary Kenyans that trekked to work everyday.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ORSUkuft38U">Nikikutazama</a></strong> - “Nikikutazama” (When I look at you) which was also a massive success played beyond the borders of Kenya. It was a song that appreciated the beauty of a woman as the singer describes how happy he was whenever he saw the woman. </li>
